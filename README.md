# MorphAL plugin for QGIS

## Description

MorphAL (for Morphological Analysis) automates a set of processes and indicator calculations to facilitate the identification and the characterisation of morphology of urban and rural tissues using vector data.

The primary purpose of these computed indicators and geometric outputs is to facilitate the search for landscape structuring logics, but they can also be easily used in other contexts.

## Documentation

Documentation (in French only for now) is available at <https://doc.ptm.huma-num.fr/morphal/>.

MorphAL is described in detail in this [article](https://doi.org/10.4000/books.pufr.7717).
